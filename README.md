# rock-paper-scissor

this demo game is a simulation of the popular "rock, paper, scissors" game.
the user picks an option out of a number of available options
the computer selects a random option
both options are compared and the winner is displayed as an output and the game ends
if there is no winner, the user gets to play again.
